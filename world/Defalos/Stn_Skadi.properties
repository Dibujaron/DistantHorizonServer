splash.0="Who's there? You ain't a cop, are ya?"
splash.1="Hey buddy, wanna buy some RuSh?"
splash.2=The Skadi began as the pirate crew of the legendary Captain Deax. \nNow, 100 years later, their organized crime operation stretches across several systems.
splash.3=You've never seen a more wretched hive of scum and villany.
splash.4=On the way in to the bar, you're nearly knocked over by a large \nman being thrown out the door by a much larger man.
splash.6=You hear raucous laughter and chatter from the common room. \nSounds like Yisheng Industries just lost another freighter.
splash.7=For a station so close to Yisheng, the cuisine here is questionable. \nThough, come to think of it, you've never seen a Skadi dining in the same room as an outsider...
splash.9=Something is creaking behind you as you walk down the corridor â€” \nis that just the station settling? Or are you being followed?
splash.10=From the outside, Skadi Hideout looks like it was put together \nfrom spare parts. The inside doesn't look much better.
