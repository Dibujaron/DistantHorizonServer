splash.0=Environmental problems? What environmental problems?
splash.1=*ding* BOI is currently hiring new security officers! \nPrior military experience required. \nAnti-riot training a plus.
splash.2=Best tread carefully here. \nEvery single one of those security officers is a trigger-happy mercenary.
splash.3=Every now and then you hear the miners whisper to one another in a language you don't recognise. \nThe security guards don't seem to like it.
splash.4=*ding* Attention! This sector is under lockdown for a routine security sweep. \nPlease remain in place until your ID has been scanned. *ding*
splash.5=Pretty much the only good food here is the candied guljee berries from automat 74. \nIf you want some, you'll have to wait in line.
splash.6=They don't let outsiders and locals mix at the canteen. \nYou only ever see the miners in passing. They never look happy to be here.
splash.7=On your way to the canteen, you see a guard \npainting over some graffiti of a crying eye. There's dried blood on the floor.
splash.8=You can't see them, but you know that there are cameras everywhere here.
splash.9=A guard captain at the door sees your pistol \nand half-heartedly tries to recruit you. You politely decline.
